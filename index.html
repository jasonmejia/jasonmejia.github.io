I have worked in several research labs. I am interested in how our persona ,personality arises from living tissue.
I am interested in knowing at what point a group of cells start to have life or properties that caracterize such as life, cognition or choerent neural activity starts. 
When a group of neurons start to produce activity that it is choerent for the system as whole in creating cognition.
Those are questions that I want to reply with my research. Jason Mejia
