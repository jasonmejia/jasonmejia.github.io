I have worked in several research labs. I am interested in how our persona ,personality arises from living tissue. 
I am interested in knowing at what point a group of cells start to have life or properties that caracterize such as life,
cognition or choerent neural activity starts. When a group of neurons start to produce activity that it is choerent for 
the system as whole in creating cognition. Those are questions that I want to reply with my research.
