I currently work as a Science Instructor at High School where I teach science for students that are new to US. Those students are mostly from Spanish America, with mostly speaking Spanish as mother Spanish and Native Languages. 
They come from different educational background with the majority having already finished midle school. They are placed on different levels of high school.
I teach Physics, Math, Biology and Chemistry.  
The classes are taught in bilingual envyroment and follow the normal curriculum designated,
The main difference it is that all the instruction it is done in a Bilingual format in small classes where all the students undertand Spanish.
All the class material and  lectures are translated and adapteted for these group of students.
I focus on a critical and analytical process for learning. I make these by promoting discussion about the topics.
In addition lab practices I emphasize the process of doing the experimentation, I do this by having small group of students and one to one attention.
I also hold office hours I work in small group setting to finish homework and complement acitvities, such online quiz and finish homework given for the class.
I also promote debate between the students to discuss experiments.
I guide them to have conclusions and write experimment summaries.
